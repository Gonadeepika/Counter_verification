=======================================================

Solver failed when solving following set of constraints 


rand bit[3:0] data_in; // rand_mode = ON 

constraint c1    // (from this) (constraint_mode = ON) (../env_lib/count_trans.sv:13)
{
   (data_in inside {[2:0]});

Note-[CNST-SATE] Standalone test extracted
  A standalone test-case for this failure has automatically been extracted 
  from randomize serial 500 partition 1.
  To reproduce the error using the extracted testcase, please use the 
  following command:
  cd /home1/BPRN01/GonaD/VLSI_RN/SV_LABS/counter/sim/./simv.cst/testcases;
  vcs -sverilog extracted_r_500_p_1_inconsistent_constraints.sv -R
  To reproduce the error using the original design and verbose logging, re-run
  simulation using:
  simv +ntb_solver_debug=trace +ntb_solver_debug_filter=500
  To reproduce the error using the original design and debug the error with 
  Verdi/DVE:
  1. re-compile the original design with -debug_access+all, if not already 
  done so
  	% vcs -debug_access+all <other options>
  2. re-run the simulation interactively with -gui/-verdi
  	% simv -gui/-verdi <other options>
  3. enter the following commands to begin interactive constraint 
  inconsistency debug within Verdi/DVE
  	I. set the breakpoint:	verdi/dve> stop -solver -serial 500
  	II. run the simulation till it stops:	verdi/dve> run
  	III. step in the constraint solver:	verdi/dve> step -solver

  Constraints are inconsistent and cannot be solved.
  Please check the inconsistent constraints being printed above and rewrite 
  them.
