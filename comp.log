Warning-[ICPSD_W] Illegal combination of drivers
../env_lib/count_if.sv, 7
  Illegal combination of structural and procedural drivers.
  Variable "up_down" is driven by an invalid combination of structural and 
  procedural drivers. Variables driven by a structural driver cannot have any 
  other drivers.
  This variable is declared at "../env_lib/count_if.sv", 7: logic up_down;
  The first driver is at "../test/top.sv", 12: rtl xyz( .clk (clock),  .din
